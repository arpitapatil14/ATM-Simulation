# ATM-Simulation
Welcome to the ATM Simulation Project! This console-based Java application simulates the operations of an ATM machine, allowing users to check their balance, withdraw funds, deposit funds, and exit the system. Realistic transactions, user-friendly. Demonstrates Java skills. Valuable reference for developers and learners. Passion-driven project.
Project Highlights:
- Implemented a command-line based ATM simulation.
- Users can check their account balance, withdraw funds, and make deposits.
- Utilized Java programming concepts to handle user interactions and update account balances.
- This ATM program allows users to check their balance, withdraw funds, deposit funds, and exit the system whereas the withdrawal conditions  ensures that the withdrawal amount doesn't violate the minimum balance requirement.
Certainly! Here's an example of what you could include in the README file of your ATM project:
